# Components

The XDS-110 connector CON1 is a Samtec TML-110-01-G-D-SM  
The TAG connector CON2 is a Wurth Elektronik 61201021621  
R1 - R4 are optional 0R 0603 resistors.  These are not used currently, but I prefer to have this option available for future use  

The used TAG connector is a TC2050-IDC and is available from: 

[TC2050 on tag-connect.com](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2050-idc-tag-connect-2050-idc)

# Assembly

The board is easy to assembly by hand using a small tip soldering Iron and flux. 

The XDS-110 connector has a no pin hole on it's 6th pin position.  This pin must be cut off from the Samtec connector.
