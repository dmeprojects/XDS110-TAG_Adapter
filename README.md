Gerber files are available

# Board

The board measures 44x25.5mm and is a dual layer configuration.  

# Components

The XDS-110 connector CON1 is a Samtec TML-110-01-G-D-SM  
The TAG connector CON2 is a Wurth Elektronik 61201021621  
R1 - R4 are optional 0R 0603 resistors.  These are not used currently, but I prefer to have this option available for future use  

The used TAG connector is a TC2050-IDC and is available from:

# Assembly

The board is easy to assembly by hand using a small tip soldering Iron and flux. 

The XDS-110 connector has a no pin hole on it's 6th pin position.  This pin must be cut off from the Samtec connector.
